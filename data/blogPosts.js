# Essential Nutrition Guidelines for Growing Pigs

Proper nutrition is the cornerstone of successful pig farming. Understanding the dietary requirements at different growth stages ensures optimal health, growth rates, and feed conversion efficiency.

## Key Nutritional Components

### Protein Requirements
Growing pigs require high-quality protein sources to support muscle development. The protein content should vary based on weight:
- **10-20 kg**: 18-20% crude protein
- **20-50 kg**: 16-18% crude protein  
- **50-100 kg**: 14-16% crude protein

### Energy Sources
Corn and barley provide excellent energy sources. The digestible energy should be:
- **Starter pigs**: 3,400 kcal/kg
- **Growing pigs**: 3,300 kcal/kg
- **Finishing pigs**: 3,200 kcal/kg

### Essential Minerals
- **Calcium**: 0.6-0.8% for bone development
- **Phosphorus**: 0.5-0.6% for skeletal growth
- **Salt**: 0.3-0.5% for proper metabolism

## Feeding Schedule

Implement a structured feeding program:
1. **Ad libitum feeding** for young pigs
2. **Restricted feeding** for breeding stock
3. **Multiple daily feedings** for optimal digestion

## Water Requirements

Clean, fresh water is crucial:
- Growing pigs need 2-3 liters per kg of dry feed
- Lactating sows require up to 30 liters daily
- Water temperature should be 10-15°C

## Common Nutritional Mistakes

Avoid these frequent errors:
- Inadequate protein in starter feeds
- Insufficient mineral supplementation
- Poor feed storage leading to spoilage
- Inconsistent feeding schedules

Remember, proper nutrition directly impacts profitability through improved feed conversion ratios and reduced veterinary costs.
